# Introduction

This repository provides a wide range of check plugins for the Open Source monitoring solution [Icinga 2](https://icinga.com). All included plugins will require the [Icinga PowerShell Framework](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework) as core framework for executing checks and providing Icinga formated output.

This repository will be extended whenever there are new plugins available. The separation will ensure updates of plugins are possible without having to upgrade huge elements of the PowerShell Framework itself.

Please have a look at the [Installation Guide](02-Installation.md) to get started.
